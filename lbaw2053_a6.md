# A6: Indexes, triggers, user functions, transactions and population

The product consists of an online auction website where you are able to bid on and create auctions.
<br/>   
In this artifact, we intend to define the physical schema of our database. We will present a prediction of the database load, create indexes to improve performance and create triggers to assure the integrity of the database whenever certain values in certain tables are inserted, updated or deleted.

## 1. Database Workload
 
> A study of the predicted system load (database load), organized in subsections.  
 
### 1.1. Tuple Estimation
 
> Estimate of tuples at each relation.

## 2. Proposed Indices

### 2.1. Performance Indices

> Indices proposed to improve performance of the identified queries.  

| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT06                               |
| **Relation**        | notification                           |
| **Attribute**       | id_buyer                               |
| **Type**            | Hash                                   |
| **Cardinality**     | medium                                 |
| **Clustering**      | Yes                                    |
| **Justification**   | Given that this query is executed many times, it's performance is extremely important. An hashed index will allow a linear search through the table. The id_buyer attribute has medium cardinality due to the fact that an user can have multiple notifications associated to him. For this same reason, this index is a good candidate for clustering.    |
```sql 
 CREATE INDEX notification_id ON "notifications" USING hash(id_buyer);
```
<br/>

| **Index**           | IDX03                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT08                               |
| **Relation**        | watchlists                             |
| **Attribute**       | id_buyer                               |
| **Type**            | Hash                                   |
| **Cardinality**     | medium                                 |
| **Clustering**      | Yes                                    |
| **Justification**   | Given that this query is executed many times, it's performance is extremely important. An hashed index will allow a linear search through the table. The id_buyer attribute has medium cardinality due to the fact that an user can have multiple auction in his watchlist. For this same reason, this index is a good candidate for clustering.    |
```sql 
CREATE INDEX watchlists_id ON watchlists USING hash(id_buyer);
```
<br/>

| **Index**           | IDX04                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT09                               |
| **Relation**        | auction                                |

| **Type**            | Hash                                   |
| **Cardinality**     | high                                   |
| **Clustering**      | Yes                                    |
| **Justification**   | Given that this query is executed many times, it's performance is extremely important. An hashed index will allow a linear search through the table. The id_seller attribute has medium cardinality due to the fact that a seller can create multiple auctions. For this same reason, this index is a good candidate for clustering.     |
```sql 
CREATE INDEX auction_id ON auction USING hash(id_seller);
```
<br/>

| **Index**           | IDX05                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT11                               |
| **Relation**        | bids                                   |
| **Attribute**       | id_buyer                               |
| **Type**            | Hash                                   |
| **Cardinality**     | high                                   |
| **Clustering**      | Yes                                    |
| **Justification**   | Given that this query is executed many times, it's performance is extremely important. An hashed index will allow a linear search through the table. The id_buyer attribute has medium cardinality due to the fact that a buyer can bid multiple times and in multiple auctions. For this same reason, this index is a good candidate for clustering.     |
```sql 
CREATE INDEX bids_id ON bids USING hash(id_buyer);
```
<br/>

### 2.2. Full-text Search Indices 

> The system being developed must provide full-text search features supported by PostgreSQL. Thus, it is necessary to specify the fields where full-text search will be available and the associated setup, namely all necessary configurations, indexes definitions and other relevant details.  

| **Index**           | IDX01                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT03                               |
| **Relation**        | auction                                |
| **Attribute**       | name                                   |
| **Type**            | GiST                                   |
| **Clustering**      | No                                     |
| **Justification**   | The index type choosen was GiST because it is better than GIN to deal with dynamic data. This index is proposed in order to improve the performance of full text searches while searching for auctions.   |
```sql 
CREATE INDEX search_auction ON auction USING GIST (to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || species_name || ' ' || description ))
```
<br/>

| **Index**           | IDX02                                  |
| ---                 | ---                                    |
| **Related queries** | SELECT04                               |
| **Relation**        | user                                   |
| **Attribute**       | name                                   |
| **Type**            | GiST                                   |
| **Clustering**      | No                                     |
| **Justification**   | The index type choosen was GiST because it is better than GIN to deal with dynamic data. This index is proposed in order to improve the performance of full text searches while searching for users in the admin dashboard.   |
```sql 
CREATE INDEX admin_search ON "user" USING GIST (to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || email ))
```
<br/>

## 3. Triggers
 
> User-defined functions and trigger procedures that add control structures to the SQL language or perform complex computations, are identified and described to be trusted by the database server. Every kind of function (SQL functions, Stored procedures, Trigger procedures) can take base types, composite types, or combinations of these as arguments (parameters). In addition, every kind of function can return a base type or a composite type. Functions can also be defined to return sets of base or composite values.

## 4. Transactions
 
> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.  

| SQL Reference   | Select Reports to display in Admin Dashboard    |
| --------------- | -----------------------------------             |
| Justification   | In the middle of the transaction, the insertion of new rows in the auction table can occur, which implies that the information retrieved in both selects is different, consequently resulting in a Phantom Read. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects.     |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY                          |
```sql 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY
 
SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM Reports
 
SELECT reports.date, report_status.TYPE, B.name, S.name
    FROM (((reports 
        JOIN report_status ON reports.id = report_status.id_reports) 
        JOIN ((buyer ON reports.id_buyer = buyer.id JOIN "user" ON user.id = buyer.id) AS B))
        JOIN ((seller ON seller.id = reports.id_seller JOIN "user" ON user.id = buyer.id) AS S))
    ORDER BY reports.date DESC
    LIMIT 10;
 
COMMIT;
```
<br/>

| SQL Reference   | Select Auction Information and Bidding History  |
| --------------- | -----------------------------------             |
| Justification   | When viewing an auction, there are two queries that need to occur to get all the data related to the auction: the auction information (species name, description, current price, etc) and the bidding history (last 5 bids). Since the last bid corresponds to the current price, then this these two values must be equal. Therefore, this transaction assures that these values match even when a new bid occurs between the two queries. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects. |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY                          |
```sql 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY

SELECT auction.*, skill.TYPE, category.TYPE, main_color.TYPE, development_stage.TYPE
    FROM ((((auction JOIN features ON auction.id = features.id_auction) 
            JOIN skill ON skill.id = features.id_skill) 
            JOIN category ON category.id = auction.id_category)
            JOIN main_color ON main_color.id = auction.id_main_color)
            JOIN development_stage ON development_stage.id = auction.id_dev_stage
    WHERE auction.id = $id_auction;

SELECT bids.value, user.name
    FROM auction JOIN bids ON bids.id_auction = auction.id
    WHERE bids.id_buyer = $id_auction
    ORDER BY bids.id DESC
    LIMIT 5;

COMMIT;
```
<br/>

| SQL Reference   | Select Auctions in Profile                      |
| --------------- | -----------------------------------             |
| Justification   | When a buyer views its profile, he has access to its purchase history (past auctions he won) and its ongoing auctions (ongoing auctions that he has bidded). If the ending date of one of the ongoing auctions is reached between the two queries and the buyer wins, that auction should be displayed in the purchase history and not in the ongoing auctions. Therefore, this transaction assures that the status of the auction is the same in these two queries. It's READ ONLY because it only uses Selects. |
| Isolation level | SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY                          |
```sql 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY

SELECT auction.id, species_name, current_price, age, ending_date
    FROM auction.auction JOIN auction_status ON auction.id = auction_status.id_auction
    WHERE auction.id_winner = $id_buyer AND auction_status.TYPE = 'Finished'
    ORDER BY ending_date DESC;

SELECT DISTINCT auction.id, species_name, current_price, age, ending_date
    FROM (auction JOIN auction_status ON auction.id = auction_status.id_auction) JOIN bids ON bids.id_auction = auction.id
    WHERE bids.id_buyer = $id_buyer AND auction_status.TYPE = 'Ongoing'
    ORDER BY ending_date;

COMMIT;
```

## 5. SQL Code

> The database script must also include the SQL to populate a database with test data with an amount of tuples suitable for testing and with plausible values for the fields of the database.  
> This code should also be included in the group's git repository as an SQL script, and a link include here.
